        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Marian Xu and I am currently a student at University of California- Riverside studying Pre-Business. I am able to communicate in both English and Chinese fluently. I can provide customers with enthusiasm and exemplary work ethic. Also, due to my work experiences, I am highly focused and responsible on m given tasks that will guarantee to contribute my full effort to the customers.My current job is at a tie-down strap company called Everest Group USA. My position in this company is to assist both the accounting and the sales side of the company with their projects and assignments. My weekly assignments include online orders, weekly analysis report, data entry, product tracking, market research, customer service, and e-commerce. This job offers the chance for me to explore the business field and the workforce. I am able to see the actual business field and how to interact with people with diverse background.<br><br>

        My first job is volunteering as a office worker at a hospice. I worked in the administration of Brio Hospice to help file patients files, organize employee files, set up events. In addition, my job required me to enter the patientsâ€™ data onto the computer and make sure all the information are accurate and up-to-date. This work offered me the opportunity to become experienced office worker by understanding the criterias needed to become a expected employee. Also, I learned the importance to have a high responsibility in the workforce with all the given documents especially since all the given files at a hospice means more than just papers; these papers means life and death, and the patientsâ€™ stories. My first paying job was at Daiso Japan, working as a cashier for six months. My job was to receive payments by cash, cards, and mobile pays. Also, in charge of counting money and reporting sales for opening and closing. Most importantly as a cashier, greeting customers, maintaining clean checkout areas, and resolving customer complaints are also part of my job.<br><br>

        I am a hardworking and motivated workers interseted in the Marketing field. I hope I am able to work within international companies to help tie a stronger bond between the countries. Since I am able to speak both English and Mandarin, I am happy to work in both America and China. International trades is an interesting area for me. Additionally, I have strengthened my skills in the work environment over the past years of working in different field with various assignments. Moreover, I have contributed to improving the business by successfully completing tasks and projects resulting in increased performance and productivity. I have a clear, logical mind with practical approach to problem- solving and drive to see assignments through completion. Also, I am eager to learn, I enjoy working with various people to improve my skills. I love overcoming challenges, and I have genuine interest in Marketing. As a part-time student, I am seeking for a position in the industry in which I can put into practice my knowledge and experience, ultimately benefiting the operations of the organization that I work for.
